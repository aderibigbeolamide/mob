Nice üëç Adding a **Landing Page** makes sense since this EMR will need an entry point for external users (patients, partners, or even hospital staff before logging in). I‚Äôll extend the PRD with **Landing Page requirements**.

Here‚Äôs the updated PRD with **Landing Page** added:

---

# **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **Electronic Medical Record (EMR) System**

---

### **1. Project Overview**

The EMR system is a branch-specific, role-based medical record management platform designed to streamline patient care, clinical workflows, billing, and communication across different hospital units. The system supports multiple staff roles with distinct permissions, in-app messaging, and notifications to ensure smooth operations.

A **Landing Page** will serve as the public-facing entry point to introduce the hospital/clinic EMR system, provide information to patients, and allow quick access to login or appointment booking.

---

### **2. Objectives**

* Provide a **centralized patient record system** accessible to authorized staff.
* Support **branch-specific operations** with login tracking and attendance.
* Enable **role-based workflows** for front desk, nurses, doctors, lab technicians, pharmacy, billing, and accounting.
* Ensure **smooth patient flow handovers** between staff via clock-out notifications.
* Provide a **public landing page** for external visibility, patient engagement, and system entry.

### **3. User Roles & Permissions**

*(same as previously updated, with Front Desk final clock-out logic applied)*

‚ö° Question for you:
Do you want the **Landing Page** to be **generic (for hospital info)**, or more of a **Patient Portal** (where patients can log in, book appointments, check bills, etc.)? That choice will determine how much **interactivity** we add to the landing page.
