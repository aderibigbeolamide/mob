Excellent! I found the key components. Now let me use the architect tool to thoroughly analyze the application workflow and answer all your questions:

Based on my comprehensive analysis of the application, here's what I found:
Current Hospital Workflow Implementation
✅ What Works Now:

The application has a linear, fixed workflow that works like this:

    Front Desk → Clocks in patient and creates visit
    Nurse → Clocks in, records vitals
    Doctor → Clocks in, provides consultation
    Lab → Processes tests
    Pharmacy → Dispenses medication
    Billing → Processes payment
    Returned to Front Desk → Patient clocks out

Each role has their own queue/dashboard showing patients waiting for them.
Your Questions - What's Missing:
❌ 1. Can Front Desk Change Doctor if Unavailable?

NO - The system currently has no appointment editing feature. Once a doctor is booked, it cannot be changed. The API only allows creating and viewing appointments, not updating them.
❌ 2. Nurse-Only Care (No Doctor Needed)?

NO - The workflow is hardcoded and linear. If a patient only needs nurse care, there's no way to complete the visit without going through all stages (Doctor → Lab → Pharmacy → Billing). The nurse cannot mark the visit as complete.
❌ 3. Nurse Sends Patient to Lab First?

NO - The system forces the order: Nurse → Doctor → Lab. The nurse cannot skip the doctor and send the patient directly to the lab for tests first.
❌ 4. Patient Admission & Extended Billing?

NO - The system has no admission/inpatient functionality. It only handles single-visit outpatient care. There's no way to:

    Admit a patient for multiple days
    Track ongoing care during admission
    Calculate billing for the admission period

❌ 5. Doctor Redirects Patient Back to Nurse?

NO - The workflow only moves forward. A doctor cannot hand a patient back to the nurse for follow-up care. It's a one-way flow.
✅/❌ 6. Admin Monitoring?

PARTIAL - The admin can:

    ✅ View overall statistics (total patients, appointments, revenue)
    ✅ See pending appointments
    ❌ BUT cannot monitor real-time queue activities
    ❌ Cannot see admission status or detailed operational flow

Summary: What Has Been Done vs. What Needs Work
✅ Completed Features:

    Basic patient registration and management
    Appointment booking (create only)
    Linear visit workflow with clocking system
    Role-based queues (Nurse, Doctor, Lab, Pharmacy, Billing)
    Basic vital signs recording
    Invoice generation for completed visits
    Role-based dashboards
    Basic admin statistics

❌ Missing/Needs Work:

    Flexible Workflow Routing
        Allow nurse-only visit completion
        Enable lab-first routing (Nurse → Lab → Doctor)
        Support doctor-to-nurse handbacks
        Allow skipping unnecessary stages

    Appointment Management
        Edit/update appointments
        Reassign doctors
        Handle scheduling conflicts

    Admission System
        Inpatient admission tracking
        Multi-day care management
        Admission-period billing calculation

    Enhanced Admin Features
        Real-time queue monitoring
        Operational oversight
        Admission status tracking

    Advanced Billing
        Admission-based billing
        Multi-day stay calculations
        Insurance integration

Bottom Line:

The application currently supports only a basic, rigid outpatient workflow. It works well if every patient follows the exact same path (Front Desk → Nurse → Doctor → Lab → Pharmacy → Billing → Checkout), but it cannot handle:

    Flexible care pathways
    Nurse-only visits
    Doctor reassignment
    Lab-first routing
    Patient admissions
    Doctor-to-nurse returns

Would you like me to implement any of these missing features to make the hospital workflow more realistic and flexible?
