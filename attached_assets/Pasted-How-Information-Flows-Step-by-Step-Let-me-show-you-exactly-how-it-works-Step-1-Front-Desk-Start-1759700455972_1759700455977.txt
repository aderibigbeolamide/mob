How Information Flows (Step-by-Step)

Let me show you exactly how it works:
Step 1: Front Desk Starts the Visit

Action: Front desk checks in patient
System Updates:
- currentStage = "front_desk"
- stages.frontDesk.clockedInBy = Front desk staff ID
- stages.frontDesk.clockedInAt = Current time

Step 2: Transfer to Nurse

Action: Front desk clicks "Send to Nurse"
System Updates:
- currentStage = "nurse"
- stages.frontDesk.clockedOutAt = Current time
- Notification sent to nurse: "New patient waiting"

Step 3: Nurse Records Vitals

Action: Nurse enters blood pressure, temperature, weight, etc.
System Updates:
- stages.nurse.vitalSigns = {BP: "120/80", temp: 98.6, ...}
- stages.nurse.clockedInBy = Nurse ID
- Same visit record is updated (NOT a new record)

Step 4: Transfer to Doctor

Action: Nurse clicks "Ready for Doctor"
System Updates:
- currentStage = "doctor"
- stages.nurse.clockedOutAt = Current time
- Notification sent to doctor: "Patient ready, vitals recorded"
- Doctor can see all nurse's vitals in the same record

Step 5: Doctor Adds Diagnosis

Action: Doctor enters diagnosis, creates prescription, orders lab test
System Updates:
- stages.doctor.diagnosis = "Influenza"
- stages.doctor.prescription = Link to prescription record
- stages.doctor.labTests = [Link to lab test order]
- Same visit record, now with more information

Step 6: Transfer to Lab (if needed)

Action: Doctor clicks "Send to Lab"
System Updates:
- currentStage = "lab"
- Lab technician sees the lab test order from doctor
- Lab tech adds results to the lab test record
- Lab test is linked to this visit

Step 7: Transfer to Pharmacy (if needed)

Action: Doctor/Lab clicks "Send to Pharmacy"
System Updates:
- currentStage = "pharmacy"
- Pharmacist sees prescription from doctor
- Pharmacist marks medication as dispensed
- All charges are tracked for billing

Step 8: Generate Invoice at Billing

Action: System sends to Billing
System Collects:
- Consultation fee (from doctor visit)
- Lab test charges (from lab)
- Medication charges (from pharmacy)
System Creates:
- Invoice with all charges
- Links invoice to this visit

ðŸ”” Key Mechanisms to Ensure Data Transfer

Here's what you need to implement to make this work smoothly:
1. REAL-TIME NOTIFICATIONS

When someone moves a patient forward:

Nurse clicks "Send to Doctor"
â†’ System automatically notifies doctor
â†’ "Patient [Name] is ready, vitals recorded"
â†’ Doctor dashboard shows new patient in queue

2. DEPARTMENT DASHBOARDS

Each department sees their pending work:

Nurse Dashboard:
- Patients waiting for vitals (currentStage = "nurse")
- Shows 5 patients in queue

Doctor Dashboard:
- Patients ready for consultation (currentStage = "doctor")
- Can see patient's vitals from nurse

3. LINKED RECORDS

All related information is connected:

Visit â†’ Patient â†’ Vitals â†’ Diagnosis â†’ Prescription â†’ Lab Tests â†’ Invoice
Everything linked through the visit ID

4. API ENDPOINTS FOR UPDATES

Each department uses API calls to update the visit:

POST /api/visits/[visitId]/update-stage
{
  "newStage": "doctor",
  "nurseNotes": "Patient ready, all vitals recorded"
}

âœ… What You Need to Implement

Your data models are already perfect! You just need to:
1. Create the Update Flow APIs (Most Important!)

/api/visits/[id]/transfer-to-nurse
/api/visits/[id]/transfer-to-doctor
/api/visits/[id]/transfer-to-lab
/api/visits/[id]/transfer-to-pharmacy
/api/visits/[id]/transfer-to-billing

2. Build Department Queues

Each department sees their pending patients:

    Nurse Queue: All visits where currentStage = "nurse"
    Doctor Queue: All visits where currentStage = "doctor"
    Lab Queue: All visits where currentStage = "lab"

3. Add Notification System

When stage changes, notify next person:

    Send in-app notification
    Update their dashboard count
    Optional: SMS/Email for urgent cases

4. Create Handoff Buttons

Add buttons in the UI:

[Send to Nurse] â†’ Updates currentStage, notifies nurse
[Send to Doctor] â†’ Updates currentStage, notifies doctor
[Send to Lab] â†’ Updates currentStage, notifies lab

5. Display Full Visit Timeline

Show everyone what happened before:

Patient Visit Timeline:
9:00 AM - Checked in (Front Desk - Jane)
9:15 AM - Vitals recorded (Nurse - Mary)
9:30 AM - Diagnosed (Doctor - Dr. Smith)
10:00 AM - Lab test ordered
10:30 AM - Results ready
11:00 AM - Medication dispensed

ðŸš€ Practical Example of Data Flow

Let me show you a complete real-world example:

Patient: Sarah Johnson arrives at 9:00 AM

    Front Desk (9:00 AM): Creates visit record
        Visit ID: V-2025-001
        Patient: Sarah Johnson
        Current Stage: front_desk
        Clocked In By: Jane (Front Desk)

    Transfer to Nurse (9:05 AM): Front desk clicks "Send to Nurse"
        Current Stage: nurse
        Notification: "New patient waiting for vitals"

    Nurse (9:15 AM): Records vitals in same visit V-2025-001
        BP: 120/80
        Temp: 98.6Â°F
        Weight: 65kg
        Current Stage: still "nurse"

    Transfer to Doctor (9:25 AM): Nurse clicks "Ready for Doctor"
        Current Stage: doctor
        Doctor sees same visit V-2025-001 with all vitals

    Doctor (9:35 AM): Adds diagnosis to same visit V-2025-001
        Diagnosis: "Hypertension"
        Prescription: Created and linked
        Lab Test: Blood work ordered and linked

    Transfer to Lab (9:50 AM): Doctor clicks "Send to Lab"
        Current Stage: lab
        Lab sees visit V-2025-001 with doctor's orders

    Lab (10:15 AM): Adds results to same visit V-2025-001
        Test results uploaded
        Charges: $50 added

    Transfer to Pharmacy (10:30 AM): Automatic
        Current Stage: pharmacy
        Pharmacist sees prescription from same visit

    Pharmacy (10:45 AM): Dispenses medication
        Medication given
        Charges: $30 added

    Transfer to Billing (11:00 AM): Automatic
        Current Stage: billing
        System generates invoice from visit V-2025-001
        Total: Consultation ($100) + Lab ($50) + Meds ($30) = $180

    Payment & Complete (11:15 AM): Front desk
        Payment received
        Current Stage: completed
        Visit closed

All departments worked on the SAME visit record (V-2025-001)!
ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps to Implement This

Would you like me to:

    Build the API endpoints for transferring patients between stages?
    Create the department queue pages showing pending patients?
    Set up the notification system to alert next department?
    Build the visit timeline view showing complete patient journey?
