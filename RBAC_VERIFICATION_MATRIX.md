## API Route Protection Summary

### Protected POST/PUT/DELETE Endpoints
✅ `/api/appointments` - FRONT_DESK, ADMIN  
✅ `/api/prescriptions` - DOCTOR, ADMIN  
✅ `/api/pharmacy` - PHARMACY, ADMIN  
✅ `/api/lab-tests` - DOCTOR, LAB, ADMIN  
✅ `/api/billing/invoices` - BILLING, ADMIN, FRONT_DESK  
✅ `/api/staff` - ADMIN only  
✅ `/api/visits` - ADMIN, FRONT_DESK, NURSE, DOCTOR  

### Protected GET Endpoints (Enhanced Security)
✅ `/api/staff` - ADMIN only  
✅ `/api/billing/invoices` - BILLING, ACCOUNTING, ADMIN, FRONT_DESK  
✅ `/api/prescriptions` - DOCTOR, PHARMACY, NURSE, ADMIN  

### General Read Access (Authenticated + Data Filtering)
- `/api/patients` - All roles (filtered by branch and role scope)
- `/api/appointments` - All roles (filtered by branch and assignment)
- `/api/visits` - Clinical roles (filtered by branch and involvement)
- `/api/lab-tests` - Clinical + Lab roles (filtered appropriately)
- `/api/pharmacy` - Clinical + Pharmacy roles (filtered appropriately)

## Frontend Component Protection

### Sidebar Menu Filtering
Implemented via `filterMenuByRole()` function in `sidebar.tsx`
- Automatically filters menu items based on `allowedRoles` array
- Nested submenus also filtered
- Dynamic rendering based on user session role

### Dashboard Routing
Implemented via `RoleDashboardRouter.tsx`
- Role-specific dashboard components:
  - AdminDashboard.tsx
  - DoctorDashboard.tsx
  - NurseDashboard.tsx
  - LabDashboard.tsx
  - PharmacyDashboard.tsx
  - BillingDashboard.tsx
  - AccountingDashboard.tsx
  - FrontDeskDashboard.tsx

### Permission Gate Component
`PermissionGate.tsx` component available for fine-grained UI control
- Uses `usePermissions` hook
- Supports `requireAll` or `canAny` logic
- Fallback rendering for unauthorized access

---

## Security Implementation Details

### Middleware Stack
1. **requireAuth**: Basic authentication check
2. **checkRole**: Role-based access control
3. **requirePermission**: Fine-grained permission check
4. **withBranchScope**: Branch-level data isolation
5. **canModifyResource**: Resource ownership verification

### Permission System
- **ROLE_PERMISSIONS** mapping in `rbac.ts`
- **ResourceAction** types for all operations
- **Role hierarchy** for permission inheritance
- **Branch filtering** for multi-location support

### Data-Level Security
- Branch-scoped queries via `buildRoleScopedFilters()`
- Role-based data filtering in GET endpoints
- Owner-based access control for user data
- Automatic population of user context

---

## Testing Checklist

### For Each Role:
- [ ] Login with role credentials
- [ ] Verify sidebar shows only authorized menu items
- [ ] Check dashboard displays role-appropriate data
- [ ] Test unauthorized menu access (should redirect/error)
- [ ] Verify API calls succeed for allowed operations
- [ ] Confirm API calls fail for forbidden operations
- [ ] Check data filtering (only see relevant records)
- [ ] Verify branch scoping works correctly

### Cross-Role Testing:
- [ ] Admin can access all features
- [ ] Doctor cannot access billing/accounting
- [ ] Nurse cannot create prescriptions
- [ ] Front desk cannot approve lab tests
- [ ] Lab cannot access pharmacy
- [ ] Pharmacist cannot access lab
- [ ] Accountant cannot access medical records
- [ ] Billing cannot access full accounting

## Notes

1. All API routes use NextAuth session for authentication
2. Role information stored in JWT session token
3. Branch filtering ensures multi-location data isolation
4. Permission checks happen both frontend (UX) and backend (security)
5. Audit logging recommended for sensitive operations (future enhancement)

## Security Enhancements Applied (October 6, 2025)

Enhanced API endpoint protection for sensitive data:

1. **Staff GET** (`/api/staff`) - Restricted to ADMIN only
2. **Billing/Invoices GET** (`/api/billing/invoices`) - Restricted to BILLING, ACCOUNTING, ADMIN, FRONT_DESK
3. **Prescriptions GET** (`/api/prescriptions`) - Restricted to DOCTOR, PHARMACY, NURSE, ADMIN
4. **Documents GET** (`/api/documents`) - Restricted to ADMIN, DOCTOR, NURSE, FRONT_DESK

All enhancements reviewed and approved by system architect.
