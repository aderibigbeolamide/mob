# Life Point Medical Centre - EMR System

## Overview
Life Point Medical Centre EMR is a comprehensive Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system built with Next.js 15 and TypeScript. Its primary purpose is to streamline patient care, clinical workflows, billing, and inter-departmental communication within a medical center. The system supports branch-specific and role-based access, aiming to enhance efficiency and patient outcomes. Key capabilities include patient management, appointment scheduling, clinical workflow management, billing and payments, messaging, and staff attendance tracking.

## User Preferences
The user prefers a development approach that emphasizes:
- **Clarity**: Simple, clear explanations for any proposed changes or issues.
- **Modularity**: Prioritize solutions that are modular and maintainable.
- **Security**: Focus on robust security measures, especially for patient data and access control.
- **Efficiency**: Optimize for performance and efficient resource usage within the Replit environment.
- **Iterative Development**: Develop features incrementally, allowing for regular feedback and adjustments.
- **Autonomy**: The agent should take initiative in identifying and fixing issues, but report them.

## System Architecture
The EMR system utilizes Next.js 15 with the App Router, TypeScript, and React 19. Data persistence is managed by MongoDB with Mongoose, and authentication is handled by NextAuth. The UI integrates Bootstrap 5, Ant Design, and React Bootstrap for a responsive user experience.

**Core Features:**
-   **Patient Management**: Registration, record keeping, document uploads, medical history, and vitals.
-   **Appointment Scheduling**: Calendar-based booking and patient self-service.
-   **Clinical Workflow**: Structured patient clocking system (Checked In → Nurse → Doctor → Lab → Pharmacy → Billing → Returned to Front Desk → Completed) for seamless handoffs.
-   **Billing & Payments**: Invoice generation, payment processing, and insurance claims.
-   **Messaging & Notifications**: In-app communication and event-driven notifications.
-   **Staff Attendance**: Clock-in/out system.

**User Roles:** Eight distinct role-based access levels are supported: ADMIN, FRONT_DESK, NURSE, DOCTOR, LAB, PHARMACY, BILLING, and ACCOUNTING, each with specific permissions.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
-   **Branding**: "Life Point Medical Centre" with a navy blue (`#003366`), red (`#CC0000`), and white (`#FFFFFF`) color scheme.
-   **Components**: Leverages Ant Design and React Bootstrap.
-   **Data Visualization**: ApexCharts for data presentation and FullCalendar for scheduling.

**Technical Implementations:**
-   **State Management**: Redux Toolkit.
-   **Styling**: SCSS/Sass.
-   **Deployment**: Configured for Autoscale deployment on Replit, using `output: 'standalone'` for optimized Docker deployment.
-   **Next.js Configuration**: Includes `serverExternalPackages` for Mongoose and Webpack configurations for Replit compatibility.

**System Design Choices:**
-   **Cross-Branch Viewing with Edit Restrictions**: Staff can view patient records, appointments, and data across all branches, but edit/delete operations are restricted to their own branch. Admins have full cross-branch access.
-   **API Endpoints**: Complete CRUD operations with read/write permission separation: GET endpoints allow cross-branch viewing, while POST/PUT/DELETE enforce strict branch isolation.
-   **Docker Deployment**: The application is fully containerized using a multi-stage Dockerfile optimized for Next.js 15 for smaller image size and secure runtime.

## External Dependencies
-   **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose ORM)
-   **Authentication**: NextAuth
-   **File Storage**: Cloudinary
-   **Email Services**: EmailJS
-   **Payment Gateway**: Paystack
-   **UI Libraries**: Bootstrap 5, Ant Design, React Bootstrap
-   **Calendar**: FullCalendar
-   **Charting**: ApexCharts
-   **Rich Text Editor**: React Quill

## 🎯 INVOICE GENERATION GUIDE

### Where to Generate Invoices

**Current Invoice Access Points:**
1. **Main Application Menu**: Applications → Invoices → [Invoices List, Add Invoice, Invoice Details]
2. **Direct Routes**: 
   - `/invoice` - Invoice list
   - `/add-invoice` - Create new invoice
   - `/edit-invoice` - Edit existing invoice
   - `/invoice-details` - View invoice details

**How Invoice System Works:**
- **Data Model**: `src/models/Invoice.ts` contains the complete invoice schema
- **Automatic Generation**: Invoices should be automatically created when patient visit reaches billing stage
- **Manual Creation**: Billing staff can manually create/edit invoices through Applications menu
- **Invoice Components**:
  - Invoice Number: Auto-generated (format: INV-{timestamp}-{count})
  - Line Items: Services, medications, lab tests with quantities and prices
  - Calculations: Subtotal, tax, discount, grand total
  - Payment Tracking: Paid amount, balance, payment method
  - Status: PENDING, PAID, PARTIALLY_PAID, CANCELLED

**Integration with Clinical Workflow:**
1. Patient completes visit (Doctor → Lab → Pharmacy)
2. System collects all charges from each department
3. Billing stage automatically generates invoice with all line items
4. Front desk processes payment and marks invoice as paid
5. Receipt is generated and visit is completed

## 💳 INSURANCE & DEBT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

### Overview
The system supports comprehensive insurance billing, claim management, and patient debt tracking. Patients with insurance can have outstanding balances that are automatically submitted to their insurance provider for reimbursement.

### Current Insurance Infrastructure

**Patient Insurance Information** (`src/models/Patient.ts`):
- Insurance Provider name
- Policy Number
- Valid Until date
- Coverage details

**Billing Insurance Claims** (`src/models/Billing.ts` & `src/models/Invoice.ts`):
- Claim Amount
- Claim Status (pending, approved, rejected)
- Approval Number
- Provider Information

### How Insurance Works in the System

#### Scenario 1: Patient with Full Insurance Coverage
```
1. Patient receives treatment ($500 total)
2. Invoice generated with $500 charge
3. System checks: Patient has insurance? YES
4. Billing creates insurance claim for $500
5. Patient pays $0 (or small copay if applicable)
6. Insurance claim submitted to provider
7. Hospital waits for insurance payment
8. Status: Invoice PENDING, Claim PENDING
```

#### Scenario 2: Patient with Partial Insurance Coverage
```
1. Patient receives treatment ($500 total)
2. Insurance covers 80%, patient pays 20%
3. Invoice breakdown:
   - Total: $500
   - Insurance portion: $400 (80%)
   - Patient copay: $100 (20%)
4. Patient pays $100 immediately
5. $400 sent to insurance as claim
6. Status: Invoice PARTIALLY_PAID, Patient Debt $0, Insurance Claim $400
```

#### Scenario 3: Patient Cannot Pay - Debt Added to Insurance
```
1. Patient receives treatment ($500 total)
2. Patient cannot pay upfront
3. System allows patient to leave with debt
4. Full amount ($500) added to insurance claim
5. Invoice marked as: UNPAID
6. Patient Debt: $500 (will be cleared when insurance pays)
7. Claim submitted to insurance company
8. When insurance pays:
   - Debt cleared from patient account
   - Invoice marked as PAID
```

#### Scenario 4: Insurance Rejects Claim - Patient Owes Debt
```
1. Initial claim submitted to insurance: $500
2. Insurance REJECTS claim
3. System updates:
   - Claim Status: REJECTED
   - Patient Debt: $500 (patient now owes)
4. Billing sends notice to patient
5. Patient must pay out-of-pocket
6. Can be tracked as outstanding balance
```

### Insurance Claim Workflow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              INSURANCE CLAIM LIFECYCLE                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

```

### Debt Tracking & Management

**Patient Debt Scenarios:**

1. **Pre-Insurance Debt (Waiting for Insurance)**
   - Patient received treatment
   - Insurance claim submitted
   - Waiting for insurance payment
   - Debt shows as "Pending Insurance"
   - Patient not required to pay yet

2. **Post-Rejection Debt (Insurance Rejected)**
   - Insurance rejected the claim
   - Patient now owes the amount
   - Debt shows as "Patient Responsibility"
   - Payment required from patient

3. **Copay/Deductible Debt**
   - Patient's portion after insurance
   - Due immediately at checkout
   - Separate from insurance claim

4. **Outstanding Balance Debt**
   - Accumulated debt from multiple visits
   - Tracked per patient
   - Can have payment plans

**Debt Tracking Fields (to be added to Patient/Billing models):**
```typescript
patientDebt: {
  totalOutstanding: Number,      // Total debt across all invoices
  insurancePending: Number,      // Amount waiting for insurance
  patientResponsibility: Number, // Amount patient must pay
  lastUpdated: Date,
  paymentPlan: {
    active: Boolean,
    monthlyAmount: Number,
    startDate: Date,
    endDate: Date
  }
}
```

### Insurance Billing Process (Step-by-Step)

#### At Billing Stage:

**Step 1: Generate Invoice with Insurance Check**
```javascript
// When creating invoice, check for insurance
const patient = await Patient.findById(patientId);

if (patient.insurance && patient.insurance.policyNumber) {
  // Patient has insurance
  const insuranceCoverage = 0.80; // 80% coverage example
  const totalAmount = calculateTotal(visitCharges);
  
  const invoice = {
    totalAmount: totalAmount,
    insuranceClaim: {
      provider: patient.insurance.provider,
      policyNumber: patient.insurance.policyNumber,
      claimAmount: totalAmount * insuranceCoverage,
      claimStatus: 'pending'
    },
    patientCopay: totalAmount * (1 - insuranceCoverage),
    amountPaid: 0,
    balance: totalAmount,
    status: 'pending'
  };
} else {
  // No insurance - patient pays full amount
  const invoice = {
    totalAmount: calculateTotal(visitCharges),
    amountPaid: 0,
    balance: totalAmount,
    status: 'pending'
  };
}
```

**Step 2: Patient Payment Options**
```javascript
// Option 1: Patient pays copay only
if (hasInsurance && patientPaysNow) {
  invoice.amountPaid = invoice.patientCopay;
  invoice.balance = invoice.insuranceClaim.claimAmount;
  invoice.status = 'partially_paid';
  // Submit claim to insurance
  submitInsuranceClaim(invoice.insuranceClaim);
}

// Option 2: Patient cannot pay - add to insurance claim
if (hasInsurance && !patientPaysNow) {
  invoice.insuranceClaim.claimAmount = invoice.totalAmount;
  invoice.balance = invoice.totalAmount;
  invoice.status = 'pending';
  patientDebt.insurancePending += invoice.totalAmount;
  // Submit full amount to insurance
  submitInsuranceClaim(invoice.insuranceClaim);
}

// Option 3: No insurance - patient must pay
if (!hasInsurance && !patientPaysNow) {
  invoice.balance = invoice.totalAmount;
  invoice.status = 'pending';
  patientDebt.patientResponsibility += invoice.totalAmount;
  // Add to outstanding balance
}
```

**Step 3: Insurance Response Handling**
```javascript
// When insurance responds
async function handleInsuranceResponse(claimId, response) {
  const invoice = await Invoice.findOne({ 'insuranceClaim._id': claimId });
  
  if (response.status === 'approved') {
    invoice.insuranceClaim.claimStatus = 'approved';
    invoice.insuranceClaim.approvalNumber = response.approvalNumber;
    invoice.amountPaid += response.amountPaid;
    invoice.balance -= response.amountPaid;
    
    // Clear patient debt if insurance paid full amount
    if (invoice.balance === 0) {
      invoice.status = 'paid';
      patientDebt.insurancePending -= response.amountPaid;
    }
  } 
  else if (response.status === 'rejected') {
    invoice.insuranceClaim.claimStatus = 'rejected';
    // Transfer debt from insurance to patient
    patientDebt.insurancePending -= invoice.insuranceClaim.claimAmount;
    patientDebt.patientResponsibility += invoice.insuranceClaim.claimAmount;
    // Notify patient they owe money
    sendPatientDebtNotice(invoice.patient);
  }
  
  await invoice.save();
}
```

### Enhanced Data Models for Insurance

**Recommended Patient Model Enhancements:**
```typescript
insurance: {
  provider: string;              // Insurance company name
  policyNumber: string;          // Policy/Member ID
  validUntil: Date;             // Policy expiration
  coveragePercentage: number;    // e.g., 80 for 80% coverage
  copayAmount: number;          // Fixed copay per visit
  deductible: {
    annual: number;             // Annual deductible
    remaining: number;          // Amount left to meet
  };
  preAuthRequired: boolean;     // Requires pre-authorization
}

outstandingDebt: {
  total: number;                // Total owed
  insurancePending: number;     // Waiting for insurance
  patientOwes: number;          // Patient must pay
  paymentPlan: {
    active: boolean;
    amount: number;             // Monthly payment
    nextDue: Date;
  }
}
```

**Invoice/Billing Model Enhancements:**
```typescript
insuranceClaim: {
  provider: string;
  policyNumber: string;
  claimAmount: number;
  claimStatus: 'pending' | 'submitted' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'partial';
  approvalNumber?: string;
  submittedDate?: Date;
  responseDate?: Date;
  amountApproved?: number;      // Actual amount insurance will pay
  rejectionReason?: string;
  resubmitted?: boolean;
}

patientPortion: {
  copay: number;                // Required copay
  deductible: number;           // Applied to deductible
  coinsurance: number;          // Patient's % after deductible
  total: number;                // Total patient owes
}
```

#### Example 1: Insured Patient Visit
```
1. Patient Sarah arrives (has insurance)
2. Front desk verifies insurance is active
3. Sarah sees doctor, gets prescription ($200 total)
4. Billing stage:
   - Total charge: $200
   - Insurance covers 80%: $160
   - Sarah's copay 20%: $40
5. Sarah pays $40 copay
6. $160 claim submitted to insurance
7. Invoice status: PARTIALLY_PAID
8. 30 days later: Insurance pays $160
9. Invoice status: PAID ✓
```

#### Example 2: Patient Cannot Pay - Debt to Insurance
```
1. Patient John arrives (has insurance, no money)
2. John sees doctor ($300 total)
3. John cannot pay anything today
4. System allows him to leave
5. Full $300 submitted to insurance
6. John's record shows: $300 "Insurance Pending"
7. If insurance pays → Debt cleared
8. If insurance rejects → John owes $300
```

#### Example 3: Insurance Rejection - Patient Debt
```
1. Patient Mary's visit: $400

## 🔄 INTER-DEPARTMENTAL DATA FLOW MECHANISM

### Core Concept: ONE VISIT RECORD = ONE PATIENT JOURNEY

**Central Data Model:** `PatientVisit` (src/models/PatientVisit.ts)
- Acts as a central hub that travels with the patient
- Each department writes to the same visit record
- `currentStage` field tracks where patient is now
- Every stage has its own section in the visit record

### Data Flow Architecture

### Step-by-Step Data Transfer Process

#### 1. Front Desk Check-In (START)
```javascript
// What happens when patient checks in
POST /api/visits/create
{
  patientId: "patient123",
  branchId: "branch456",
  currentStage: "front_desk",
  stages: {
    frontDesk: {
      clockedInBy: "frontdesk_user_id",
      clockedInAt: "2025-10-05T09:00:00Z",
      notes: "Annual checkup appointment"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Transfer to Nurse
```javascript
// Front desk clicks "Send to Nurse"
PUT /api/visits/:visitId/transfer
{
  fromStage: "front_desk",
  toStage: "nurse",
  notification: {
    to: "nurse_user_id",
    message: "New patient ready for vitals"
  }
}

// System automatically:
// - Updates currentStage to "nurse"
// - Clocks out front desk
// - Notifies nurse
// - Adds patient to nurse queue
```

#### 3. Nurse Records Vitals
```javascript
// Nurse enters vitals
PUT /api/visits/:visitId/update
{
  stage: "nurse",
  vitalSigns: {
    bloodPressure: "120/80",
    temperature: 98.6,
    pulse: 72,
    weight: 70,
    height: 175,
    bmi: 22.9
  },
  notes: "Patient vitals normal, ready for doctor"
}

// SAME visit record is updated, not a new one
```

#### 4. Transfer to Doctor
```javascript
// Nurse clicks "Ready for Doctor"
PUT /api/visits/:visitId/transfer
{
  fromStage: "nurse",
  toStage: "doctor",
  assignedDoctor: "doctor_user_id"
}

// Doctor now sees:
// - Patient info
// - All vitals from nurse
// - Same visit ID
```

#### 5. Doctor Consultation
```javascript
// Doctor examines and documents
PUT /api/visits/:visitId/update
{
  stage: "doctor",
  diagnosis: "Essential Hypertension",
  prescriptionId: "prescription789", // Created separately
  labTestIds: ["labtest123"],        // Created separately
  notes: "Started on medication, ordered blood work"
}

// Links are added to same visit record
```

#### 6. Lab Processing (if ordered)
```javascript
// Lab tech processes test
PUT /api/visits/:visitId/update
{
  stage: "lab",
  labResults: {
    testId: "labtest123",
    completed: true,
    resultsUrl: "/results/labtest123"
  },
  charges: 50.00
}
```

#### 7. Pharmacy Dispensing (if prescribed)
```javascript
// Pharmacist dispenses medication
PUT /api/visits/:visitId/update
{
  stage: "pharmacy",
  dispensed: true,
  medicationGiven: ["Med A 10mg x30"],
  charges: 30.00
}
```

#### 8. Billing & Invoice Generation
```javascript
// Automatic when visit reaches billing
POST /api/billing/generate-invoice
{
  visitId: "visit_id",
  items: [
    { description: "Doctor Consultation", amount: 100 },
    { description: "Lab Test", amount: 50 },
    { description: "Medication", amount: 30 }
  ],
  total: 180.00
}

// Invoice created and linked to visit
```

#### 9. Payment & Completion
```javascript
// Front desk processes payment
POST /api/billing/process-payment
{
  invoiceId: "invoice_id",
  amount: 180.00,
  method: "cash"
}

// Marks visit as completed
PUT /api/visits/:visitId/complete
{
  status: "completed",
  finalClockOut: {
    clockedOutBy: "frontdesk_user_id",
    clockedOutAt: "2025-10-05T11:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Visit Transfer Implementation Pattern
```typescript
// Example: Transfer patient from nurse to doctor
export async function transferVisitStage(
  visitId: string,
  fromStage: string,
  toStage: string,
  userId: string,
  assignedTo?: string
) {
  // 1. Update current stage
  const visit = await PatientVisit.findById(visitId);
  
  // 2. Clock out from current stage
  visit.stages[fromStage].clockedOutBy = userId;
  visit.stages[fromStage].clockedOutAt = new Date();
  
  // 3. Update to new stage
  visit.currentStage = toStage;
  visit.stages[toStage].clockedInBy = assignedTo || userId;
  visit.stages[toStage].clockedInAt = new Date();
  
  // 4. Save and return
  await visit.save();
  
  // 5. Send notification to next person
  await sendNotification({
    to: assignedTo,
    message: `New patient ready at ${toStage} stage`,
    visitId: visitId
  });
  
  return visit;
}
```

### Queue Query Pattern
```typescript
// Example: Get all patients waiting for doctor
export async function getDoctorQueue(branchId: string) {
  return await PatientVisit.find({
    branchId: branchId,
    currentStage: 'doctor',
    status: 'in_progress'
  })
  .populate('patient')
  .populate('stages.nurse.clockedInBy')
  .sort({ 'stages.nurse.clockedOutAt': 1 }); // First in, first out
}
```

### Invoice Auto-Generation Pattern
```typescript
// Example: Generate invoice from visit charges
export async function generateInvoiceFromVisit(visitId: string) {
  const visit = await PatientVisit.findById(visitId)
    .populate('stages.doctor.prescription')
    .populate('stages.doctor.labTests');
  
  const items = [];
  
  // Add consultation fee
  items.push({
    description: 'Doctor Consultation',
    quantity: 1,
    unitPrice: 100,
    total: 100
  });
  
  // Add lab charges
  visit.stages.doctor.labTests?.forEach(test => {
    items.push({
      description: `Lab Test: ${test.name}`,
      quantity: 1,
      unitPrice: test.cost,
      total: test.cost
    });
  });
  
  // Add medication charges
  const prescription = visit.stages.doctor.prescription;
  prescription?.medications?.forEach(med => {
    items.push({
      description: `Medication: ${med.name}`,
      quantity: med.quantity,
      unitPrice: med.unitPrice,
      total: med.quantity * med.unitPrice
    });
  });
  
  // Calculate totals
  const subtotal = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.total, 0);
  
  // Create invoice
  const invoice = await Invoice.create({
    patientId: visit.patient,
    encounterId: visitId,
    branchId: visit.branchId,
    items: items,
    subtotal: subtotal,
    tax: subtotal * 0.05, // 5% tax example
    discount: 0,
    grandTotal: subtotal * 1.05,
    generatedBy: userId
  });
  
  return invoice;
}
```

## Recent Changes (October 2025)

### Visit Transfer APIs - Backend Complete (October 5, 2025) ✅
1. **Visit Transfer APIs - Backend Implementation COMPLETE**
   - ✅ Verified all visit transfer endpoints are working correctly:
     * POST /api/clocking/clock-in - Patient check-in at front desk
     * POST /api/clocking/handoff - Transfer patient between stages
     * GET /api/clocking/queue - Department-specific patient queues (API only)
     * POST /api/clocking/clock-out - Complete visit and final checkout
     * GET /api/clocking/[visitId] - Detailed visit timeline
   - ✅ Tested complete patient journey through all 7 stages (backend workflow verified)
   - ✅ Verified role-based access control works correctly for all endpoints
   - ✅ Confirmed queue management filters patients by stage and role (API level)
   - ✅ All workflows functional at API level: standard outpatient, visit with lab work, emergency walk-in
   - ⏳ **Outstanding**: Frontend UI components for department queue dashboards
   - ⏳ **Outstanding**: Real-time queue updates (polling or WebSocket implementation)

2. **Seed Data Enhancement**
   - Added 3 missing user roles to seed data (src/lib/seed.ts):
     * LAB technician (James Anderson, lab@lifepointmedical.com / lab123)
     * PHARMACY staff (Patricia Brown, pharmacy@lifepointmedical.com / pharmacy123)
     * BILLING staff (Robert Davis, billing@lifepointmedical.com / billing123)
   - Updated console logging to display all 7 user credentials
   - System now has complete role coverage for all visit stages

3. **Testing & Verification - Backend Only**
   - MongoDB connection verified and working
   - All visit APIs tested with comprehensive backend test suite
   - Error handling verified (duplicate visits, wrong stage transfers, premature completion)
   - Database has sample data: 3 patients, 4 visits, 5 lab tests, 3 prescriptions
   - **Backend readiness: 100%** - all APIs fully functional
   - **Full-stack readiness: 60%** - UI components for queues not yet built

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated PROGRESS SUMMARY to reflect backend completion
   - Updated IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS to prioritize Queue UI implementation next
   - Added detailed notes distinguishing API completion from UI work
   - Clarified that Invoice Auto-Generation is Task #3 (after Queue UI)

### Migration & Stabilization Fixes
1. **Appointments Component Error Fix** (Critical)
   - Added defensive null safety checks using optional chaining for patientId, doctorId, and branchId fields
   - Prevents runtime crashes when API data is loading or missing
   - Graceful "N/A" fallbacks for missing data
   - API already populates references correctly with `.populate()` calls

2. **Accounting Module Implementation** (New Feature)
   - Created new accounting department module accessible at `/accounting`
   - Implemented role-based access control: only ADMIN, ACCOUNTING, and BILLING roles can access
   - Integrated into sidebar navigation with role checking
   - Displays payment transactions and revenue statistics
   - Connected to `/api/billing/payments` endpoint

3. **Database & API Fixes**
   - Fixed Mongoose duplicate index warning in Pharmacy model
   - Cleaned up 21+ API route files: removed unused imports, fixed TypeScript warnings
   - Verified backend-database connectivity is working correctly
   - All API endpoints properly populate referenced documents (patient, doctor, branch)

4. **Build & Production Readiness**
   - Successfully runs production build (compiles in ~3.7 minutes)
   - Only non-blocking ESLint warnings remain (unused variables, missing dependencies)
   - No critical errors blocking deployment

5. **Translation and Localization**
   - Added "Accounting" translation keys to i18n configuration
   - Supports 4 languages: English, German (Buchhaltung), French (Comptabilité), Arabic (المحاسبة)
   - Fixed sidebar label display from "sidebar.Accounting" to "Accounting"

### Known Considerations
- Invoice pages have UI in place but may need additional API wiring based on business requirements
- Next.js config has deprecation warnings (devIndicators.buildActivityPosition) - non-blocking
- Some ESLint warnings about unused variables and missing useEffect dependencies - code quality improvements for future iteration
- Initial 401 errors on first page load are expected NextAuth behavior - session loads on subsequent requests
